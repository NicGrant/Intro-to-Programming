            For this assignment we are to create a new file called game.html and then create another
            file JavaScript file that will hold the code for the game and the game.html will show the 
            game. For the sack of the assingment I will be using adding this html and add my other pages and link
            them all together so I can use the other pages for portfilo use or something down the line.
